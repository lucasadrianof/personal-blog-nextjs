# Lucas Felicio Adriano personal website

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the project

My personal website rewritten with Next.js and Tailwind CSS (it was originally written with Hugo and had only static content).

The Homepage, About Me, and Contact pages are static, while all pages under `/blog/*` are dynamic and their content is served from Sanity. All these have their content cached by default on Server (SSG) and are re-validated via a webhook that's fired every time their content changes.

The website is hosted on Vercel and the CI/CD pipeline [is configured on GH Actions](https://github.com/lucasadrianof/personal-blog-nextjs/blob/master/.github/workflows/prod-deployment.yml), deploying to production every time a new commit is pushed to the `main` branch.
